                I am Kshitij Dhannoda, a dedicated and passionate software engineer with a strong background in Computer and Information Sciences. My journey in the world of technology began at the University of Michigan, Dearborn, where I pursued my Masters in Computer and Information Sciences, specializing in General Computer Science. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology, India.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a keen interest in exploring and mastering various programming languages and frameworks, I have honed my skills in JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Python, C, Dart, and PHP. My expertise extends to frameworks such as React-Native, Flutter, Native-script, OpenCV, Hadoop, PySpark, Django, and Next.js. Proficient in utilizing tools like GIT, Docker, Android Studio, Microsoft Office, and LaTeX, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of clients and users alike.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my professional journey, I have had the privilege of gaining valuable experience through internships and apprenticeships. As a Software Intern at the Free Software Movement of India, I contributed to enhancing user experiences through the design and implementation of React components. During my tenure as a Next.js Developer Intern at Provoke Developers, I played a key role in translating design concepts into interactive web applications, thereby significantly improving the online presence of businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my technical expertise, I possess strong soft skills including communication, collaboration, adaptability, problem-solving, leadership, and time management. These qualities have enabled me to effectively lead teams, manage projects, and deliver results in dynamic and fast-paced environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my professional endeavors, I am deeply involved in various leadership and community initiatives. As an Internship Coordinator for the Swecha Summer Internship Program and a Technical Support Lead for the NMREC Summer Internship Program, I mentored and guided aspiring young minds in the field of technology. I also served as a Tech Lead for the GNU/Linux User Group, organizing events and workshops to promote open-source software and hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by a passion for continuous learning and innovation, I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact on society.
