    <h2>Step Tracker Application</h2>
    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
        The standalone step tracking app, developed with Flutter, not only breaks free from the limitations of closed-source, platform-specific health tracking apps but also prioritizes user privacy as its central tenet. By leveraging the versatility of Flutter, the app runs seamlessly across various platforms, including Android, iOS, and custom ROMs, ensuring accessibility for all users. The decision to store all data locally on users’ devices, coupled with the utilization of device sensors for step counting, reflects a privacy-by-design approach that minimizes reliance on external servers and preserves user anonymity. With the use of a SQLite database to manage step counts and long-term progress, the app provides a secure environment for users to track their health data without compromising their privacy, empowering them with full control over their information.

    <h4>Key Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Step Counting:</strong> Utilize the accelerometer’s Z-axis readings to detect and count user steps in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Display:</strong> Display the current step count prominently on the main screen, providing users with immediate feedback on their activity level.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Implement SQLite to store daily step counts, ensuring that users can track their progress over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Data Tracking:</strong> Allow users to view their step history, offering insights into their activity patterns and motivating consistent exercise.</li>
        <li><strong>User Notifications:</strong> Send notifications to users to encourage regular activity and remind them to meet their step goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable Goals:</strong> Enable users to set daily step goals, promoting personalized fitness targets and enhancing motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Design a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users of all ages to navigate and use the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
    <p>Flutter, Dart, SQLite.</p>
    <h4>Significance</h4>
    <p>
        The Step Tracker Application exemplifies proficiency in mobile app development using Flutter and Dart.
